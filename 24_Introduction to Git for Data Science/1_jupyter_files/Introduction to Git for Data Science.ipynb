    "### What is version control?\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project. Many version control systems exist; this lesson focuses on one called Git, which is used by many of the data science tools covered in our other lessons. Its strengths are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git.\n",

This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like 7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.\n",

    "Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same. Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well. Git can therefore tell what information needs to be saved where by comparing hashes rather than comparing entire files.\n",

In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work, and checking out as loading that saved version.\n",
